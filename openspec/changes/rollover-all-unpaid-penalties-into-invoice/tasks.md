# Tasks

- [x] Documented proposal/design/spec for rolling all unpaid penalties into the current invoice with a toggle.
- [x] Implemented billing rollover logic, metadata, and configurable toggle in `billingService.js`.
- [x] Updated invoice/PDF rendering in `BillingManagement.jsx` to show the aggregated penalty line item without duplicate rows.
- [x] Sanity-checked logic paths; no automated tests were run in this environment.
