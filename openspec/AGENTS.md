# OpenSpec Agent Notes

- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome; avoid extra feature work.
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations before adding complexity.
- Follow the current change instructions and keep the tasks checklist honest.
- If a toggle is introduced, default to safe behavior and document defaults.
